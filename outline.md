# Tutorial Outline

## Goal
Deliver a smart contracts demystifying experience to a web2 developer

Keep it simple

Help them walk away:
1. wanting more
2. understanding smart contracts are just automated business logic
3. with a simple, high-level understanding of smart contract code structure
4. with a conceptual understanding of the UniswapV2Pair smart contract

What we won't do:
1. comprehensive definition of smart contracts, blockchain, ethereum, AMM, etc
2. fully explain Uniswap and how it does what it does
3. explain every aspect of UniswapV2Pair

## Free Association
What we're going to build: mental model of UniswapV2Pair

Why is it interesting: drives key actions in the Uniswap AMM
- Volume traded
- Comparison to centralized exchanges
- Recent growth

Enhance technical sophistication
Reduce activation energy

*section* Solidity Toy Contract

Build a simple smart contract using Remix (see FreeCodeCamp)

Introduce basic concepts:
- pragma
- import
- contract + constructor
- types
- function
- modifier
- inheritance
- require
- libraries
- event

*section* Reviewing Key Pieces of UniswapV2Pair

Introduce Uniswap V2 architecture

What is UniswapV2Pair in the context of Uniswap V2

Review the smart contract:
- pragma
- import
- inheritance
- using SafeMath
- key variables

Focus on two functions: one simple, one more involved
- getReserves
- swap

*Conclusion*
