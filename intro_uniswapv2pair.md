# Demystifying Uniswap V2 Pair

## Introduction
*Demystifying Uniswap V2 Pair* is an introduction to the world of smart contracts for web2 developers. It is aimed at those with a basic understanding of web development systems (frontend clients, backend APIs and databases, internet protocols), so if you've ever as much as dabbled with writing code for the web, and certainly if you've ever built web2 applications, you're in the right place. Having said that, this tutorial doesn't assume any technical sophistication with smart contracts. In fact, even if you've never written code, you'll probably gain an appreciation for how much leverage is embedded in web3 systems. That is, there's a tremendous amount of value-add work being performed with minimal input.

The main intent of this tutorial is to enhance (or perhaps even kickstart) your smart contracts mental model by introducing you to the basics in the context of a simple but sophisticated smart contract - the UniswapV2Pair contract powering the core functionality of the Uniswap decentralized exchange. This contract powers a large crypto-trading liquidity pool autonomously and has supported daily trading volumes as high as $4 billion. Moreover, trading volume in Uniswap was $36 billion in April 2021 - roughly one third of Coinbase, the largest centralized crypto exchange. 

While we won't be diving deep into the basic concepts of web3 (e.g. blockchain, Ethereum, etc), we will define certain key terms along the way at a high level. Like a cartographer mapping the shore from a ship, the idea is to develop a sense for the concepts, allow for pattern matching with existing mental models, and begin to build the new mental models we'll need to expand our existing knowledge base. That's in contrast to the work of a surveyor that might study the territory up close to understand the specifics of each feature. 

Our intent is to be the exploration guide that helps you discover. In so doing, we want to help lower the activation energy for you to move from explorer to builder. Ideally, you'll walk away with a better mental model while realizing that many of the core concepts of web2 apply in the context of web3. You might even walk away having identified multiple threads (i.e. known unknowns) that you're excited to pull on.

## Smart Contracts
Before we dive into the Uniswap contract, it will be helpful to develop some intuition for smart contracts. The intent is to bridge our existing web2 mental models and abstractions so we can expand into new territory. This way we'll be able to use web2 as our basecamp and develop with concrete examples
